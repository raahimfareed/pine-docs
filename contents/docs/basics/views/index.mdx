Views are HTML files that use the Leaf template in Pine framework. Templates are 
just HTML code with added functionality; Think of it as HTML with super powers.

## Creating A View

All views are stored in `src/views` directory. Some views are compulsory such 
as the views reserved for errors and each view must end with `.leaf.html` extension.

All HTML files are valid Leaf files as well. A simple view file will be as following

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello, World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>My very first view in Pine</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## Rendering A View

Once you've a view file at hand, you may want to show it to the user. Pine 
provides a `View` class which handles importing and rendering the view. 

Let's assume we have a `hello-world.pine.html` file that we want to render

```php
use Pine\App\View;

new View("hello-world");
```

Notice how we excluded `.leaf.html` from the file name. Pine is smart enough to 
find a template with that name and render it for us. In fact, Pine will throw an 
error if you supply it the full name.

Generally you would want to render the view through a function, for example

```php
Route::get("/hello-world", function () {
    return new View("hello-world");
});
```

In this snippet, we are rendering `hello-world` when the user accesses
`/hello-world` path.
