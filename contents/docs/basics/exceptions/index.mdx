Pine uses it's own custom exception handling. You can create your own exceptions and assign specific views based on the kind of exception that is thrown.

## Creating An Exception

All custom exceptions are stored in `src/Exceptions` directory. One of the exceptions provided to the user is `RouteNotFound` exception. It's contents are
```php
namespace Pine\Exceptions;

use Pine\App\Exception;

class RouteNotFound extends Exception
{
    public function __construct(string $route)
    {
        $message = "Route not found.";
        if (!empty($route)) {
            $message .= " Path: {$route}";
        }

        parent::__construct("errors/404", $message, 404);
    }
}
```

Let's go over what is actually happening here.

The custom exception extends from an `Exception` class provided by Pine.

```php
class RouteNotFound extends Exception
```

Specifically, the `RouteNotFound` exception takes the route in its constructor
```php
public function __construct(string $route)
```

A message variable is created which is the message that is passed to the view to be shown to the user
```php
$message = "Route not found.";
```

And finally, the parent constructor is called and the view, the message and the http status code are passed as arguments to it.
```php
parent::__construct("errors/404", $message, 404);
```
