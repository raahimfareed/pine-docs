## Creating A Controller

A basic controller in Pine looks something like this

```php
namespace Pine\Controllers;

use Pine\App\Controller;
use Pine\App\View;

class SampleController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return new View("controller");
    }
}
```

The controller can have any amount of functions, it's just a PHP class which 
extends a base Controller class from Pine.

## Scaffolding

Pine offers a command line (CLI) utility which can scaffold a controller for an 
easier development time.

In order to scaffold a class, run the following command

```plaintext
./pine --make controller
```

After this, you'll be prompted to enter a name for the controller. Your output 
will look something similar to this.

```plaintext
$ ./pine --make controller
Enter controller name: UserController
Controller file './src/Controllers/UserController.php' created successfully.
```

And finally, `UserController.php` (Or whichever name you gave it) will 
look like this

```php
namespace Pine\Controllers;

use Pine\App\Controller;
use Pine\App\Request;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    public function index(Request $request) {
        
    }
};
```
