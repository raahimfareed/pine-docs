## Creating A Route

The most basic route in Pine you can create uses a URI and a Callback.
For this example, we're gonna use a GET route.

```php
use Pine\App\Route;

Route::get('/hi', function () {
    return "Hello Everyone!";
});

// Can also use one-liners
Route::get('/hi', fn () => "Hello Everyone");
```

## Using Views

You can use view files to be rendered at your routes. For a `hello-world.leaf.html`, we can do something like this

```php
use Pine\App\View;

Route::get("/hello-world", function () {
    return new View("hello-world");
});
```

## Using Controllers

You can make use of controllers and their methods for your routes as well

```php
// src/Controllers/SampleController.php
namespace Pine\Controllers;

use Pine\App\Controller;
use Pine\App\View;

class SampleController extends Controller
{
    public function index()
    {
        return new View("controller");
    }
}

// src/routes.php
use Pine\Controllers\SampleController;

Route::get("/controller", [SampleController::class, "index"]);
```

In this example, the first parameter is the uri and the second parameter is an array with the first element being the controller and the second parameter being the name of the function you want to call on that route.

## Route Methods

The following methods are supported by Pine

```php
Route::get($uri, $callback);
Route::post($uri, $callback);
Route::put($uri, $callback);
Route::patch($uri, $callback);
Route::delete($uri, $callback);
```
