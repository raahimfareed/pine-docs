## Overview

The `Response` object in Pine provides a simple and intuitive way to handle HTTP
responses. It allows you to set status codes and body as well as send back the 
response in json format.

## Creating Response

Creating a response is straightforward.
```php
use Pine\App\Response;

$response = new Response($status, $body);
```

The constructor has 2 default arguments, `status` and `body`. By default they 
are `200` and `[]` respectively.

You can change them according to your own personal preference

```php
$response = new Response(status: 200);
$response = new Response(body: [
    'message' => 'This is a response'
]);
```

## Json

It's essential for a response to be in json for most APIs. Pine's Response comes 
with a built in `json` method which encodes the response in json.

```php
$response = $response->json();
```

Once the response is converted into json, it's body is converted into json and no
longer a PHP array therefore it's advised to convert it to json at the end of your 
function when no other working will be done on the response object.

If access to a PHP array and a json body both are required, the json response can be
stored in a new variable

```php
$jsonResponse = $response->json();
```

To return back the response, the response object itself can be returned from 
the function, Pine automatically handles the rest.

```php
return $jsonResponse;
```

## Headers

It's a common practice to attach headers for certain use cases, such as 
attaching `Content-Type` to your response to let the client know your response 
content type.

### Attaching Headers

The `Response` object provides a `headers` method for setting response headers.
An array is passed to it which is attached with the response.

```php
$response->headers($array);
$response->headers(["Content-Type" => "application/json"]);
$response->headers(["X-Custom-Header" => "Custom value of header"]);
```

You can also attach multiple headers in a single go

```php
$response->headers([
    "Content-Type" => "application/json",
    "X-Custom-Header" => "Custom value of header"
]);
```

### Viewing Response Headers

The `headers` function returns back the headers that are attached with the 
response.

```php
$headers = $response->headers(); // []
$headers = $response->headers(["Content-Type" => "application/json"]); // ["Content-Type" => "application/json"]
```
