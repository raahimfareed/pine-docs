## Overview

API Handling is a crucial aspect a framework as many applications rely on some 
sort of API to communicate with the server. The most basic form of API is a 
RESTful API.

Pine provides a robust routing system and the necessary classes such as `Request`
and `Response` for API Handling.

Pine also automatically handles exceptions based on API responses. All exceptions 
are sent in JSON format if `Accept: application/json` header is present in the 
request.
