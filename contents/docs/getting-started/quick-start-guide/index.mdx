## Another Page

Let's add a new page in our application

### Routing

Pine handles all the routing in `src/routes.php` file. At first glance, your routes file should have the following contents

```php
<?php
use Pine\App\Request;
use Pine\App\Route;
use Pine\App\View;
use Pine\Controllers\SampleController;

Route::get("/", fn () => 
    new View("index", [
        "title" => "Welcome to Pine!", 
        "date" => date("Y-m-d H:i:s", time())
        ])
    );
Route::get("/controller", [SampleController::class, "index"]);
```

Our application uses `Route` for creating routes. It supports all the basic routing methods (GET, POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE).

Add the following line at the end of `src/routes.php`

```php
Route::get("/hello-world", function () {
    return new View("hello-world");
});
```

Now that we have a route, if you try to go to `/hello-world`, you'll be greeted with a rather verbose error. Don't panic, that's normal. It's because we haven't created a view named `hello-world` yet.

### Views

Before we create a view file, let's understand what they are.

Views are essentially HTML files with some additional functionality. All views can be found in `src/views` directory and must be appended by `leaf.html` extension. Let's create our first view.

Create a new file in `src/views` directory with the following name `hello-world.leaf.html` with the following contents:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello, World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>My very first view in Pine</p>
</body>
</html>
```

After this, refresh your route and your page should render properly.

Now, you may be wondering, the page looks really ugly, and you're right, it's due to the fact that no css is being used.

### Using CSS and JS

Pine serves `public/style.css` and `public/main.js` files for css and js respectively. In order to use these, all you need to do is add `@js` and `@css` to import those files into your page.

Your page should now look like this
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Hello, World</title>
    @css
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>My very first view in Pine</p>

    @js
</body>
</html>
```

If you are using Vite, you will need to edit src/resources/js/index.js and src/resources/css/index.css as vite will automatically bundle js and css for you, you will still need @css and @js to add it into your html.
