## Why Pine?

There are many other frameworks in PHP such as [Laravel](https://laravel.com) which may be a better choice for you if you want to create large scale and enterprise applications or need a batteries included framework.

Pine is a lightweight framework which provides you with a starting point with a Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach, which of course, is completely optional to use. The developer has the complete absolute control of the code with no behind the scenes magic. Pine is the perfect choice for fast prototyping that requires backend functionality as well.
