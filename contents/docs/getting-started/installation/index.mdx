description: Installation guide for Pine.
---

To use Pine, your system needs to have at least [PHP](https://php.net) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). If you intend to use vite , your system also needs to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en). Personally, we use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for installing JavaScript packages and running vite but you can use any other package manager of your choice.

<Note title="Info">
Once the first release of Pine is published, composer will also be usable for installation and setup.
